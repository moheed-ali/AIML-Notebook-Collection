# MLP Regression for California Housing

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files implementing Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regression models using Keras and TensorFlow on the California Housing dataset.

## Files

- `california_housing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code for MLP regression experiments.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Overview

The Jupyter Notebook (`california_housing.ipynb`) includes implementations of MLP regression models with different configurations, training details, and evaluation results. Each run is documented along with its corresponding results, including Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Dataset

The [California Housing dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#california-housing-dataset) is used for regression tasks, predicting housing prices based on various features.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `california_housing.ipynb` in your preferred environment.
2. Run each cell to execute the code and observe the results.
3. Experiment with different configurations, layers, neurons, and optimizers as needed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
